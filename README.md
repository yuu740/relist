Relist
Your simple, aesthetic, and cyclical task manager.

Relist is a minimal and beautiful Android application designed to manage rotating lists. It's perfect for tasks or items you cycle through regularly, like workout routines, weekly chores, movie watchlists, or deciding which playlist to listen to next.

✨ Key Features
- Create Multiple Lists: Organize all your recurring tasks into separate, independent lists.

- Smart Rotation System: When you mark an item as "used," it automatically moves to the end of the list, ensuring everything gets its turn without you having to think about it.

- Full Item Management: Easily add, edit, and delete items within any list.

- Beautiful Light & Dark Modes: A clean, aesthetic UI that looks great day or night and is easy on the eyes.

- Smooth Animations: Built with a focus on a pleasant and intuitive user experience.

- Offline First: All your lists are stored locally on your device, so no internet connection is required.
